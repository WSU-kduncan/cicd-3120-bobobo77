      <h2>Basic Plot</h2>
      
      <p>There exists an group deep in the Antarctic that is known as 
      Chaldea Security Organization. This organization's mission is to preserve
      humanity's future. To that extent, Magi have given Chaldeas the resources 
      to see up to 100 years into the future to ensure Mankind can survive at least that long. </p>
      
      <p>Chaldea has been given several tools to ensure extinction does not happen for humanity.
      Global Environmental Model Chaldeas: a magecraft view of the world. Near-Future Observation Lens
      Sheba: a mystery that can see into past and near future, and projects it onto Chaldeas.
      Heroic Spirit Summoning System Fate: A way to access the dimension known as the Throne of 
      Heroes and summon people whom have left an impact on history, and materialize them in a known
      as a class container to aid in preserving humanity. Spiritron Calculation Engine Trimegistus: 
	  a technological and magecraft combination that can convert a human body or class container into
	  spiritrons and send them to coordinates given through Sheba and Chaldeas. With these 4 pillars 
	  supporting Chaldea security Orginization, it looks like Humanity's future is safe and ensured.</p>
      
      <p>Then, in 2017, the viewing abilities of Chaldea indicated that Humanity would be
      wiped out at the dawn of 2019. This viewing platform also detected a temporal anomaly known 
      as a Singularity around a small Japanese town in the year 2004. Thanks in part to magecraft and science
      combining together to make Rayshifting, it is possible to send a spirit back in time and manifest a body
      for the spirit to interact with the world. You have been selected as one of 49 candidates who will
      partake in this mission to save humanity from extinction with the aid of historical and mythical figures 
      at your command.</p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
       
       <p> The mechanics of the game are quite easy to pick up, thanks in part to 
       the tutorial which gives a taste of the combat system and the way you summon Servants.
       The story and events keep you from being bored and Start Dash Campaigns are an amazing 
	   way to keep drawing in newcomers. </p>
	   
	   <p>Battle is a turn-based style that is easy to utilize, yet difficult to explain. You
	   can command 6 summonable characters to go into a single combat: 3 starting off, and 3 
	   to come in if any of the front line dies. Each "Servant" has five chances to attack
	   over 3 turns, and you are given five randomly from the three in combat. There are
	   three types of attacks: a damage focused attack, an attack that sets up for critical 
	   strikes the next round, and an attack that charges up your ultimate move for that
	   respective character. each character also has 3 skills to affect combat to ensure that 
	   all combat isn't exactly the same. at level one, you usually get only one skill unlocked 
	   and have to level up your character to utilize all 3.</p>
	   
	   <p>Leveling Servants is grindy, but satisfying. it is not done by sending these characters
	   into battle, but rather through giving items to them to empower them. this is honestly the most
	   tedious the game gets with needing to constantly repeat the same combat again and again to 
	   attain the materials needed thanks to atrocious drop rates.</p>

	<h2>Public Impact</h2>
	<p>To give you a comparison of how successful this game has been, Fate/Grand Order is consistently 
	in the top 20 grossing games on mobile devices every quarter, and regularly hits the top 5 grossing each quarter.
	The popularity of the game is evident from sales and downloads alone. </p>
	
	<p>Recently, there has been an anime series created for this game. This anime follows the plot of the 
	game for only the 7th chapter, but it does not care if you haven't played the game too much, only that you have 
	some knowledge of Fate beforehand.</p>
	
	<p> This game has been so successful, I doubt there will be any end to this game for a long 
	long time. It has earned more chatter than Fortnite on Twitter, and has the advantage of being playable even with low rarity Servants.
	Sony grossed more than $3 billion since launching in 2015. If this doesn't show the popularity of this game, I don't know what will.</p>

	<h2>Summoning</h2>
	<p>The main draw of the game is summoning historical figures who have left a lasting impact on history
	or myth. These beings each have massive strength and are the only way to actually fight all the enemies 
	you encounter. To summon these beings, you must use a currency called "Saint Quartz" to summon them. It
	takes 3 Saint Quartz to do a summon. This is the main currency you can find, through quest completion, daily 
	logins, and finishing weekly missions. This is also a freemium currency, meaning you can buy more with 
	actual money. You are also given Saint Quartz after every maintenance for events, so keep that in mind.</p>
	
	<p>Now, summoning can be done without Saint Quartz, and this is possible through Friend Points. 
	You can get Friend Points by using supports. It is 10 points earned per stranger, 25 points per friend,
	and 200 points for a guest servant. While this seems like a lot, it is 200 points per roll on the friend point gacha.
	You will be given a choice of support Servants at every battle, but there are a few caveats. Strangers can become friends after
	a battle, but you can only have a limited number of friends at a time. also, Guest Servants are usually weaker than 
	Friend supports or stranger supports.</p>
	
	<p>There is one other way to summon Servants, and that is through Summon tickets. Summon tickets are the 
	equivalent of a free summon on any of the saint quartz banners that you wish. You are given 1 summon ticket every time you log in 7 days in a row.
	These tickets are also available during events and Twitter/Facebook reward cycles.</p>

      <h2>General Opinion</h2>
      
      <p>This game is well-crafted and you see how much blood, sweat, and tears are put into this 
	  game to ensure a pleasing experience is given to all who play. The user interface is regularly 
	  updating to ensure new players and old players will enjoy their time playing. Events are usually
	  a tad comedic and offer up amazing prizes to make these events engrossing. </p>
	  
	  <p>In-game currency is plentiful and has multitudes of uses. Saint Quartz is what is used for sumooning
	  characters, and can even be used to revive your team in battle. Daily login rewards and login milestones
    aid in accruing materials a bit faster than just grinding. The quests all give additional rewards which 
    are more than welcome. even getting rid of Servants can help you because the remnants left behind 
    can be traded for rare goodies.</p>
    
    <p>Fate/Grand Order  also can get people interested in other parts of the Nasuverse franchise. It has
    had 6 interactions with other stories from Kinoko Nasu's head. a lot of events also pad out your lineup with 
    more potent Servants upon completion of the event. It is a game that knows how to get you hooked with 
    an amazing story and keeps you with a gacha of not atrocious rates. All in all, I highly recommend the 
    game for most people, just watch your wallet.</p>
